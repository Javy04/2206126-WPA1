            My strongest trait is overthinking. I tend to over-analyze situations, which allows me to see various possible outcomes. While this often helps me make well-informed
            decisions, it can also lead to delays or poor choices when I complicate things unnecessarily. Although this trait can be valuable, it also presents challenges. 
            I am actively working to manage it better so I can apply my insights effectively without overanalyzing. This tendency impacts my school life, especially during tests,
            exams, and time management. I frequently overthink when deciding when and how to tackle assignments, which often results in working under pressure or not accomplishing 
            what I intended.

            My strongest emotion is anxiety. It often arises in stressful situations, causing me to overthink and feel overwhelmed. While it 
            helps me stay cautious and prepared, it can also make me second-guess myself and become paralyzed by worry. This especially affects
             my school life, as I constantly worry about assignments and often can't focus until most of them are complete. I'm learning to manage it 
             better by recognizing when it happens and focusing on calming strategies to reduce its impact.

        My favorite hobby is swimming. I enjoy it because itâ€™s genuinely relaxing and an excellent way to stay in shape. Swimming positively impacts my academic life 
        by keeping me fit, which gives me more energy for my long commutes to school and helps me stay focused on my studies. Additionally, I've met some great people 
        while swimming at various pools, often gaining valuable insights about both swimming and life in general.

               Peter Parker, was a random New York teenager until he was bitten by a radioactive spider. Now going by the alias "Spider-Man", his life has changed from normal to that of one 
               full of responsibility greater than he could ever imagined. Ever since I was a little boy, he has always been my favourite super hero.

                Above is my favorite scene of Spider-Man, taken from the 2018 PlayStation 4 game titled "Spider-Man." In this pivotal moment, Peter (Spider-Man) faces the 
                heart-wrenching decision of whether to give the only dose of a cure for a lethal virus to his sick aunt, his sole family member, or to the doctors so they 
                can create more for the city. Ultimately, Peter chooses to save the city, sacrificing his beloved Aunt May after their final conversation. This scene is 
                incredibly powerful, illustrating that sometimes we must set aside our personal agendas to achieve greater goals. This resonates with my academic life as 
                well; to succeed and earn my degree, I often have to sacrifice things like free time, sleep, and social interactions.

                The results above are from the <a href="https://profile.keirsey.com/#/b2c/assessment/start" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(12, 178, 234);"><b>the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test</b></a>.
                The results showed that I fall under the Guardian category. A Guardian personality is marked by a strong sense of duty and responsibility, prioritizing the preservation of social institutions.
                They are dependable and trustworthy, valuing law and order while respecting customs and traditions for stability. Guardians prefer to work within established systems, emphasizing loyalty, discipline, and teamwork, and are generally cautious about change. The test is generally flawed because 
                it offers only two options for each question, which is quite limiting. In my case, many questions would have been more effective with a wider 
                range of choices that reflect different circumstances, as the available options often feel vague.
